# ReactTodo 📋

This user-friendly Todo application empowers you to manage your tasks effectively. Create, update, and delete tasks with ease, each featuring a title, description, and a customizable status ("To Do," "In Progress," "Done").  

## **Built with cutting-edge technologies:** 🥷🏻

* **React and TypeScript:** React provides a performant and flexible UI, while TypeScript ensures code clarity and maintainability with static typing.
* **Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind's utility-first approach offers rapid and responsive styling for a seamless user experience across devices.

## **Mobile-first Design:**  📱 🖥️
* The application prioritizes mobile usability, ensuring a smooth experience on all screen sizes.

## **Vite + Express:**  
* Leveraging Vite and Express separates the frontend and backend for efficient development.

###**In-memory Database (SQL.js):** 🧠
* SQL.js, a lightweight in-memory database, is ideal for demonstrations. The code is designed to easily migrate to a traditional SQL server by replacing a few lines. A singleton wrapper manages the connection to SQL.js, guaranteeing a single active instance.

## **Room for Improvement:** 💪🏻

* **User Authentication:**  Future implementations will integrate user logins, allowing task abstraction and personalization.
* **User Roles:**  Introducing user roles will enable granular access control, restricting task visibility based on assigned roles.
